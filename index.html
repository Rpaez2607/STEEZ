    <h1>DAIWA STEEZ AGS</h1>
        <h2>AGS GUIDES</h2>
            <p>Weighing a mere fraction of the weight of traditional guides (40% lighter than an equivalent
               sized titanium guide) AGS guides feature a solid carbon fiber frame construction that
               minimizes weight, improves casting distance and performance, and delivers faster rod speed,
               reduced rod vibration and angler fatigue, and greater rod sensitivity. (Featured on models ending in "-AGS")</p>
                        
               <h2>AIR SENSOR REEL SEAT</h2>
                        <p>Daiwa’s carbon fibre reel seat that’s minimal in weight, yet high in strength and sensitivity.
                           Our ultimate high end, high performance reel seat.</p>
                                        
                           <h2>SVF COMPILE X</h2>
                           <p>Resin is further reduced and carbon density increased through nano technology to greatly
                            enhance sensitivity, lightness and responsiveness.</p>

                            <h2>X45</h2>
                            <p>Developed to eliminate blank twist and increase power, X45 features a Bias Wrap Construction, 
                                left/right 45 degree carbon weave within the blank. X45 radically improves rod strength and 
                                durability by eliminating twist and preventing the blank from losing its round form. The 
                                elimination of this twist allows for a lighter, stronger and more powerful and sensitive rod.</p>

                                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                                <em><p>Our flagship line of rods has been upgraded, redesigned and is ready to live up to the Steez name.   
                                    Featuring a wide range of our industry leading technologies, these rods are truly the pinnacle of 
                                    design and innovation. Our new and improved AGS Guides are now even lighter than previous versions. 
                                    The high rigidity of the AGS frame offers extraordinary sensitivity- relaying vibrations on the line
                                     directly to your hand. These AGS carbon fiber guides are now truly some of the lightest guides in the world.
                                      A step above HVF and SVF blanks, SVF Compile X is a higher volume of fiber and less resin- creating a lighter,
                                       stronger and more sensitive blank than standard blank constructions. Complementing the SVF Compile X is our 
                                       Nanoplus technology.</p>

                                       This is a proprietary technology that allows us to assure even distribution of resin and carbon throughout the blank,
                                        giving you maximum power and sensitivity from every angle. Also utilizing X45, a 45 degree construction prevents twisting 
                                        of the blank for greater strength, sensitivity and hook setting power. Complete with Air Sensor Reel Seats for weight reduction
                                         and maximum palm-ability, peak performance and design have been achieved giving you a stronger and more sensitive rod. 
                                        Available in 10 casting models and 3 spinning models to cover a wide range of applications. Each rod is designed for a concept, 
                                        rather than a single technique- giving you maximum versatility when it comes to choosing the right rod for the job. 
                                        All rods are equipped with our fully adjustable Daiwa Hook Keeper and a protective rod sock.</em>
